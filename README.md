📊 CustomerNextMove
📝 Project Overview

Customer retention is one of the biggest challenges in subscription-based businesses. Losing customers (churn) directly impacts revenue and growth. The goal of this project is to build a predictive machine learning model that can identify customers most likely to churn based on their profile and usage patterns.

By doing this, businesses can proactively take action — offer promotions, improve customer experience, or provide targeted retention strategies — before customers leave.

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains information about customers and their usage behavior. Key features include:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer

Name: Customer’s name

Age: Age of the customer

Gender: Male / Female

Location: City (Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, New York)

Subscription_Length_Months: How long the customer has been subscribed

Monthly_Bill: Monthly billing amount

Total_Usage_GB: Total internet/data usage in GB

Churn: Target variable (1 = customer left, 0 = retained)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python – core programming language

Pandas & NumPy – data cleaning and preprocessing

Matplotlib & Seaborn – exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization

Scikit-learn – feature engineering, model training, and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook – interactive development environment

Confusion Matrix

ROC Curve & AUC

🚀 Approach

Data Understanding – analyzed customer behavior and churn distribution

Data Preprocessing – handled missing values, encoded categorical features, standardized numeric values

Exploratory Data Analysis – identified correlations and important drivers of churn

Model Building – experimented with multiple ML algorithms

Hyperparameter Tuning – optimized model performance with GridSearchCV and cross-validation

Evaluation – compared models using accuracy, recall, and AUC to choose the best-performing model

🎯 Outcome

The final model can predict the likelihood of a customer churning with strong accuracy. This allows businesses to:

Identify at-risk customers early

Create targeted retention campaigns

Improve overall customer satisfaction

Reduce churn rate and increase lifetime value

📌 Future Improvements

Deploy the model as a web service (e.g., Flask / FastAPI)

Integrate deep learning models (TensorFlow/Keras)

Include more customer behavior features (support tickets, feedback scores, etc.)

Automate retraining with fresh data
